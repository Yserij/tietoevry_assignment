Readme for Tietoevry pre-interview assignment.
Author: Samuel Kiszka

General notes:
##############
My solution for the assignment uses sqlite3 as the way to store data.
The file movies.db is generated the first time the app is used and then it just connects to it every other time.
Due to Docker characteristics, the database is created every time from scratch when the app is used as a Docker image.

To test the solution I used Postman to send requests.

Run as-is:
##########
To try the program without dockerization, simply run it as follows

  python movies_rest_api.py

where 'python' is the python interpreter of version at least 3.10 (as on this version it was implemented)
While the program is prepared for docker use, it uses
  app.run(port=3000, host='0.0.0.0')
and so it runs on two addresses. Both work when the app is used this way.

Run as docker image:
####################
You can use the following command in the Linux terminal to generate a docker image.

  docker build -t samuelkiszka/movies_rest_api:0.0.1.RELEASE .

Using the guidelines in the Dockerfile, a Docker image is produced and can be used by

  docker run -p 3000:3000 samuelkiszka/movies_rest_api:0.0.1.RELEASE

Or you can download a working image from dockerhub and run it the same way

  docker pull samuelkiszka/movies_rest_api:0.0.1.RELEASE

When using app this way, just the first addres works, as the other one is not connected to the outer machine from Docker.
