Readme for before-interview assignment for Tietoevry.
Author: Samuel Kiszka

General notes:
##############
My solution of the asignment uses sqlite3 as the way to store data.
The file movies.db is generated first time the app is used and then it just connect to it every other time.
But when the app is used as docer image, the database is created every time, due to the docker properties.

To test the solution I used Postman to send requests.

Run as is:
##########
To try the program without dockerization, simply run it as follows

  python movies_rest_api.py

where 'python' is pytohn interpreter of version at least 3.10 (as on this version it was implemented)
While the program is prepared for docker use, it uses
  app.run(port=3000, host='0.0.0.0')
and so it runs on two addresses. Both works when the app is used this way.

Run as docker image:
####################
To creaet docker image you can use following command in linux terminal.

  docker build -t samuelkiszka/movies_rest_api:0.0.1.RELEASE .

Docker image is created folowing the ruels from Dockerfile and can be run by

  docker run -p 3000:3000 samuelkiszka/movies_rest_api:0.0.1.RELEASE

Or you can download working image from dockerhub and run it same way

  docker pull samuelkiszka/movies_rest_api:0.0.1.RELEASE
